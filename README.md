## 1. Overview

This repository serves as a monorepo for Python applications, each of which can be individually deployed to Azure Container Apps. To ensure successful deployment, there are specific requirements for each Python project outlined below.

## 2. Requirements for Python Projects

For each Python application within this monorepo, the following requirements must be met:

- **Naming Convention:** Use only lowercase letters (a-z) in the project name. Underscores (\_) are permitted to enhance readability.
- **App & Module name must match:** The name of the Python module containing the Flask app must match the name of the app.
- **Poetry Project:** Each app must be a Poetry project, as the deployment relies on a shared Dockerfile that executes the app with Poetry.
- **Encrypted Environment Variables:** All environment variables must be encrypted and checked into Git as a `.env.enc` file. This file must exist even if it is empty.
- **Dependencies:** Ensure the inclusion of `gunicorn` and `python-dotenv` in the project's dependencies.

## 3. Managing Environment Variables

For secure transmission of secrets to the container app, we employ encryption with Sops (https://github.com/mozilla/sops) using Age (https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) keys. The repository contains a private Age key stored as a GitHub secret, and the public key is provided below:

```
{age_public_key}
```

To encrypt your environment variables, follow these steps:

1. Store all development environment variables in a `.env` file, which is excluded from Git.
2. Install `sops`:
   - On macOS, use `brew install sops`.
   - On other systems, refer to the official documentation at https://github.com/mozilla/sops.
3. After updating the `.env` file, encrypt it and refresh the `.env.enc` file with the following command:

```bash
sops --encrypt --age {age_public_key} .env > .env.enc
```

If you deploy to multiple environments (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `prod`), you can create a separate `.env` file for each environment and encrypt them accordingly. If you do so, **make sure you update the GitHub Action deployment workflow to use the correct `.env.enc` file for each environment.**

## 4. GitHub Action Deployment

Deploy each Python app using a specific GitHub Action workflow.

** Each app and each environment get its own deployment workflow **

1. In `.github/workflows`, create a new file named `<your-app-name>.<your-github-environment-name>.deploy.yaml`.
2. Insert the following workflow definition, replacing placeholders as necessary:

```yaml
name: "[<your-app-name>][üóÑÔ∏èenv: <your-github-environment-name>] Deploy to Azure Container Apps"

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read

jobs:
  deployment:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: <your-github-environment-name>
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to Azure Container Apps
        id: deploy
        uses: Unique-AG/sdk-deploy-action@v3
        with:
          module: <your-app-name>
          environment: <your-github-environment-name>
          resource_group_name: ${{ vars.AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP }}
          acr_login_server: ${{ vars.ACR_LOGIN_SERVER }}
          azure_client_id: ${{ vars.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}
          azure_tenant_id: ${{ vars.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}
          azure_subscription_id: ${{ vars.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}
          acr_username: ${{ secrets.ACR_USERNAME }}
          acr_password: ${{ secrets.ACR_PASSWORD }}
          age_private_key: ${{ secrets.AGE_PRIVATE_KEY }}
          encrypted_env_file: .env.enc
          azure_storage_account_id: ${{ vars.AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_ID }} # Supported from v3, refer upgrading below
      - name: Create Summary
        run: |
          echo "## Azure Container App ${{ steps.deploy.outputs.app_name }}" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
          echo "**FQDN:** [${{ steps.deploy.outputs.fqdn }}](https://${{ steps.deploy.outputs.fqdn }})" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
          echo "**App Name:** ${{ steps.deploy.outputs.app_name }}" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
          echo "**Environment:** ${{ steps.deploy.outputs.environment }}" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
          echo "**Resource Group:** ${{ steps.deploy.outputs.resource_group_name }}" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
          echo "**Location:** ${{ steps.deploy.outputs.location }}" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
```

3. Ensure you replace the placeholders `<your-app-name>` and `<your-github-environment-name>` with the appropriate values.
4. Customize the `with` section of the action to match your project's `sops` and `poetry` versions.
5. Commit the action to GitHub.
6. Navigate to the Actions tab in your GitHub repository.
7. Select the appropriate workflow and run it to initiate the first deployment.
8. The FQDN of your deployed app will be visible in the job summary of your GitHub Action workflow.

### Upgrading

> [!TIP]
> Unique occasionally publishes new versions of the `sdk-deploy-action`. To upgrade to the latest version, change the `uses` field in your GitHub Action workflow to `Unique-AG/sdk-deploy-action@<new-version>`. You might want to check the local [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) for guidance or the [Actions Changelog itself](https://github.com/Unique-AG/sdk-deploy-action/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) to learn about the different versions.

### Inputs

See the [action documentation](https://github.com/Unique-AG/sdk-deploy-action) for the full list.

> [!WARNING]
> There are also two more optional inputs available but they have a cost-aspect and must only be applied after consulting your teams engineer or architect.

- `cpu`: CPUs to allocate for the container app cores from 0.25 - 2.0, e.g. 0.5. Defaults to `0.5`. Only available with `Unique-AG/sdk-deploy-action@v2`.
- `memory`: Required memory from 0.5 - 4.0, will be converted to \*Gi and Gi must not be supplied. Defaults to `1`(Gi). Only available with `Unique-AG/sdk-deploy-action@v2`.

### Handling the FQDN for Webhooks

To resolve the challenge of obtaining the FQDN before configuring your `ENDPOINT_SECRET` for webhook verification, consider these approaches:

- **Option A:** Deploy the app without an `ENDPOINT_SECRET`. Once you have the FQDN, update your app and redeploy.
- **Option B:** Initially define a placeholder endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost/webhook`), use the generated signing secret, and update the endpoint with the actual FQDN later.

## 5. Deployment Environments

You have the option to request Unique to configure each of your deployments as distinct deployment environments. This allows you to select the specific environment for each deployment action. Different environments can be set up with unique requirements, such as mandatory reviews or specific wait times, before the deployment proceeds.

## 6. Dockerfile & Scaling

All apps within this repository are deployed using a shared Dockerfile. You have the option to modify the Dockerfile according to your needs and specify your custom version in the GitHub Actions as an input. The default Dockerfile utilizes `gunicorn` to run the app, configured with `2` workers and `4` threads per worker.

As we use threads, your code **must be thread-safe!** Failure to ensure thread safety may result in unpredictable behavior and potential data corruption.

**This setup allows each app replica to handle 8 concurrent requests.**

To adjust the scaling, you can change the `min_replicas` and `max_replicas` parameters in the GitHub Action. This modification enables the deployment of additional replicas of the app.

## 6.1. Debugging the Dockerfile or Build

To prepare the application code or the docker build for deployment it is recommended to run the docker build locally before each deployment. This can be done by following the steps below.

1. Make sure the following files are available

    - The latest `Dockerfile.local` or a `docker-compose.yaml` can always be found in the [template repository](https://github.com/Unique-AG/sdk-deploy-template).

    - The `Dockerfile.local` file in the root directory of the repository.
      > [!CAUTION]  
      > Never use this file for deployment. It uses unencrypted secrets and is only suitable for local debugging.

    - A `docker-compose.yaml` file in the directory of the app. Make sure the `MODULE` is set to the module name (folder name) like this example:

      ```yaml
      # <app>/docker-compose.yaml
      version: '3'
      services:
        app:
          build:
            context: .
            dockerfile: ../Dockerfile.local
            args:
              - MODULE=joke_of_the_day
          ports:
            - 5001:8080
      ```

    - Make sure to have a correct `.env` file configured as the docker will pick that one up and use its values to connect to the environment under test.

    - One can change the port (left hand side) or modify the environment variables in the `docker-compose.yaml` file to accommodate the needs of the app.

2. Run the following command **in the directory of app**:
    ```bash
    cd <app>

    docker compose up --build
    
    # older versions of docker-compose might require the following command
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

3. Now the Docker container is running locally and the logs can be checked in the console. Also build, installation as well as runtime errors will now reveal themselves.

    The container is now running under `http://localhost:5001/webhook` (or whichever port was chosen on the left hand side) as if one had run the python project with flask locally, but now in a docker container just like the ones that would be built run on the deployed container apps.

4. When _done_, press `Ctrl+C` to stop the container.

## 7. Event Socket Streaming Endpoint (SSE) - Webhooks Drop-In
Some of Unique's FSI clients restrict their developers or staff from installing tunneling tools like ngrok‚Ñ¢ to connect locally developed models with the productive Unique FinanceGPT platform. Fully deploying the models via workflows for each development iteration is time-consuming and inconvenient for developers.

The Event Socket serves as a drop-in tool that streams recent events from Unique FinanceGPT, allowing developers to receive events as if they were being called by a webhook. For more details about Event Socket and how to use it, please refer to the following link:
